# EngineeredBeer

Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.

Short version of The-Odin's document to engineer yeast. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RglbyLkZX4FRkkXWGc7PlLX41RRd_bnptrY8-Iu4x44/edit

# Overview
Brewing glow-in-the-dark beer with genetically engineered yeast by adding jellyfish genes.

I chose to brew a Orange Gose brew kit, due to its light color, dried malt extract, and contains ale yeast. I'll be using some of the dried malt extract to start my yeast and then pitch the entire contents. My kit also had grain so I could get the grain brewing experience :)

# Ingredients
## Yeast Transformation
For modifying the yeast to accept your gene.
```
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)
Agar medium for cultivating Saccharomyces cerevisiae: (YPD Agar)
Agar medium for selecting engineered cells: (YPD Agar containing Geneticin®), This will allow only the genetically modified cells with our plasmid to grow.
Yeast transformation buffer (40% PEG 8000, 200mM LiAc, 0.1mg/mL Salmon Sperm DNA)
	- 40% Polyethylene Glycol(PEG) 8000
	- 100mM Lithium Acetate(LiAc)
	- Single Stranded (SS) Carrier DNA
Yeast GFP Expression plasmid (The gene from jellyfish that fluoresces)
```

# Process
## Create a medium for yeast to grow on
The process is like making jello.
Yeast Extract, Peptone, Dextrose is the nutrient source for yeast to grow on.
We only need 2 plates: 1 for ypd, and 1 geneticin ypd. Maybe more if we want to dispose
```
 - 10 Plates
 - 6.25g LB AGAR
 - 125mL water
```
 1. Put on nitrate gloves
 2. Add 6.25g of agar to 125ml of water in a microware safe container
 3. Shake to dissolve
 4. Microwave in 30 second increments for 2-3 minutes until dissolved
 5. Pour mixture into plates so they barely fill the bottom
 6. Let cool overnight on a table
 7. After cool, store in fridge upside down

## Adding new DNA
1. Add yeast to a tube with water, shake until dissolved
2. Streak 100uL of the yeast solution onto a plate
3. Let yeast grow for 12-24 hours

1. Add 100μL yeast transformation mix to a microcentrifuge tube
2. Scrape some yeast (around 2 loopholes) and add it to the tube, stir until dissolved (pipette up and down) (can be stored at 4C)
3. Add 10μL of Yeast GFP Expression Plasmid to your 'competent' mixture
4. Incubate in 108F water for 1 hour
5. Add 1.5ml of room temperature water to a YPD microcentrifuge tube, shake to dissolve
6. Add 900μL of YPD media to the 'competent' mixture.
7. Incubate at 86F for 4-6 hours. This allows the yeast to recover. Taping it to your body a easy source of near 86F.

## Pulling out the cells that took your new DNA
1. Add 400μL of the transformation mixture to a Geneticin plate
2. Flip plate upside down and incubate at 86F for 1-3 days

# Multiplying the yeast
Yeast is generally anaerobic but requires O2 for constructing cell walls. Brewers often shake the wort or use other forms of oxygenation to promote this at the beginning of the brew. We need to multiply enough yeast to brew with. This will take at least a day. 

Repeat the process for multiple tubes to decrease the chance of contamination.
1. Boil 1/4 cup water, 1/4 cup dried malt extract, and a tiny amount of yeast nutrient if available for 20 minutes.
2. Move to a flask or other enclosed container, cool to room temperature in an ice/water bath
3. Shake vigorously to introduce oxygen
4. Let sit at room temperature for 24 hours.
(optional) 5. Cool to drop out the yeast. Separate top layer with yeast cake at the bottom. Add yeast to some falcon tubes and share with friends.
